A programme to merge all pdf files stored in put_your_pdf_files and put watermark on each page of them

Useful when having more PDF separated files(for example book chapters) or just putting watermark on pdf files

0. download the project including all files
1. create an environment inside the project folder and activate 
2. install libraries using "pip install -r requirements" on terminal
3. launch "python watermark.py" and see the final result
4. now replace all files in "put_your_pdf_files" and "put_your_watermark" by your own :) 
5. launch python file again 

PS: project is super small so I didn't test much errors with "try:" blocks but it serves 
anyway more like a backup for me
